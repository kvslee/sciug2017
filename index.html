					<h2>Sierra API <br> & <br> Visualized Data Analysis</h2>
					<br>
					<p>2017 SCIUG Conference at Chapman University <br> (Oct. 10)</p>
					<p>
						<small>Presented by Seong Heon Lee, Systems & Technology Librarian</small> 
						<small>Hugh & Hazel Darling Law Library, Chapman University </small>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
				        Welcome everyone. Hi, my name is SeongHeon. I am a systems & technology librarian at Chapman University Law Library. 
						First of all, thank you all for being my audience. Today, I want to share about Sirera SQL API and Visualized Data Analysis. 
						This presentation is motivated by my summer project, that creats an automated/visualized report using Sierra SQL API. 
						Even though I am still on the progress of the project, I found some useful things that I want to share with you. 
						<br><br>
						When SCIUG requsted presentation proposals, they also sent out a list of interests. I find that many members are 
						interested in alternative ways of doing library business analysis. And I could also see an interest of Sierra API.
						I thought that two interests can be combined as one subject. This presentation would be that one.
						I hope that you learn some useful things with this presentation.

					<h3>Final Product Preview</h3>
					<a href="circulation_report.html" target="_blank" >Circulation Transaction Report</a>
					<aside class="notes">
						Why don't we start with previewing an outcome that you are expected to build yourself after this presentation.
						This will give us a chance to understand our goal of this presentation. During the last summer, I developed 
						a circulation transaction report using Sierra SQL API and Plotly. The basic idea is to extract data from 
						Sierra's PostgreSql database and to create a visualized report. 
						<br><br>
						Let's take a look at a sample outcome.
					</aside>
					<br>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why (1)?</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Sierra has Web Management Reports</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>How many of you are using WMR?</li>
						<li>What is your user exprience?</li>
						<li>Decision Center</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						My first question is why we do need a custom report program. As you know, Sierra provides 
						with a build-in report prgoram, called Web Management Reports. How many of you are using WMR? 
						What is your user exprience? Personally, I do not have many words to say about it, 
						because I did not use it much. Preparing this presentation, I visited the report program to make 
						a quick evaluation. My first impression is that it has not been improved for a long time. 
						UI is old and not intuitive (Millenium logo, complex parameter setup). I know that Innovative has 
						a new data analytic product, Decision Center. Again, I have no word to say about Decision Center, 
						because I have no exprience. But I am sure that not all libraries are affordable to purchase the product. 
						Particularly for the libraries running a small or medium size of colletion, I am not sure 
						how much the product will pay off, even though they can purchase it. 
						<br><br>
						Library administrators try to find a right balance in using money and its ROI, as other business operators do.
						I think that Sierra API (SQL, REST) are great tools to leverage the gap. A local custom report program
						might not do all things that Decision Center does. However, it can be sufficient to take care of our business.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why (2)?</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Who uses what?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Compare resource usages among libraries</li>
						<li>Compare by other criteria:
							<ul>
								<li>locations</li>
								<li>patron types</li>
								<li>item types</li>
								<li>transaction times</li>
								<li>etc...</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Haven't you ever been curious about how different libraries use Sierra resources? Chapman
						University have three branches setup in Sierra, Leatherby, Law Library, Brandman. 
						Our library director, in one day, threw a genuine question. Leatherby and Law Library equally 
						share the cost of Sierra. In terms of the size of collections and users, the main library Leatherby
						should use more resources. That was a legitimate assumpton. She wanted to see some factual data 
						to prove or not prove that assumption. 
						<br><br>
						This is one example of how data analysis can be useful. However, our interests can stretch 
						beyond this. We may want to compare library resource usages not only by libraries but also 
						by locations, patron types,	item types, transaction times, etc.
					</aside>
					<br>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why (3)?</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Why not?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Plenty of data visualization tools</li>
						<li>Sirera offers APIs (Direct SQL & REST API)</li>
						<li>Customize a data report as you wish</li>
					</ul>				
					<aside class="notes">Why not? There are many data visualization tools available. Many of them are open source.
						For example, D3 javasript library is very popular. You may heard of many buzz words like big data, 
						AI, machine learning, etc. Our generation try to understand large amount of data that is being produced 
						every single second through online services. Although libraries do not handle extremly large data as big
						companies do, we, librarians, have also genuine interest in user behaviors and interactions. 
						<br><br>
						Thankfully, Innovative has advocated Open Library Stacks (OLS) architecture. With the merger of Polaris 
						and VTLS, OLS idea becomes more important. The main idea is to create a hightly scalable cloud platform
						to make their different products communicate each other. For this goal, APIs are critically important,
						because APIs make data sharable among other products, which can be Innovative's another product, or third body of companies',
						or your local program.
						<br><br>
						We, humans, are creative beings. We want to make reports in the format that we want. Not only data content, 
						but also data presentaiton matters. I know that you all have expriences in tweaking an excel file to create 
						a good report.

					We see that it is very easy to create a plotly chart online. In summary, to create a chart, we need
					data, plot type, attributes (axes)
					</aside>

					<h3>Plotly Offline (1)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Support multiple languages (Python, R, MATLAB, JavaScript, etc)</li>
						<li><a href="https://plot.ly/python/" target="_blank">Python Library</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/#initialization-for-offline-plotting" target="_blank">Plotly Offline Setup</a></li>
						<li>Make the "first" offline chart (as a html file)</li>
						<li>Interactive: display modeBar</li>
						<li>How to embed charts in a html?</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Plotly supports many languages, so that users can choose what they want. 
						Plotly maintains separate webpages for each language. We will choose Python. 
						<br><br>
					Python Library pages show many examples and API documentation. For example, if you go Pie Chart, 
					you will see sample codes to create a chart. Comparing the API documentation and those examples,
					you can undestand how to use the library.  <span style="color:darkgreen"> (Slide)</span>
					<br><br>
					Before creating an actual offfline chart, we need to learn a little bit how to setup the offline library.
					We will use the method, plotly.offline.plot(). 
					<br><br>
					<span style="color:darkgreen"> (Code, offline/first.py)</span>

						   <ul><li>Output Div => Template</li></ul>
						</li>
						<li>a template html</li>
						<li>an embed example</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">In most cases, we may need embeded charts. With simply changing an option of
						output type to div, we can create a embedded chart.<br><br>
						And we will use template engine and a template html file. Why? Plotly programatically outputs a chart 
						in HTML div element. We need to embed the 'div' output in a report document, as written
						in the template html.

					<aside class="notes">PGAdmin displays all viewable tables (349 tables under sierra_view schema).
						To understand Sierra database, you need to spend some times. You may browse through all tables in PGAdmin. 
						However, often times, some tables or fields are not obvious to understand. Then, you can go and refer to 
						SierraDNA, which is the most valuable resource to learn Sierra database. It includes detailed descriptions
						on tables and fields. To find the tables in your concern, you can follow category navigation links or 
						use the search box on the right top. SierraDNA shows not only detailed table view but also Entity Relationship
						Diagram. ERD is useful sometimes to create a join queries because it visualizes relationships among tables.

					<h3>Plotly & Sierra</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">How to use Sierra data in Plotly?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Re-use Plotly offline script</li>
						<li>But, with Sierra data</li>
						<li>Three things:
							<ul>
								<li>get Sierra data (connection and query)</li>
								<li>transform Sierra data to plotly data</li>
								<li>generate a Plotly chart</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Now, we have learned how to use Plotly and how to harvest Sierra data with a SQL query.
						It is time to put them together. We will reuse the Plotly offline script, because visualization logic is 
						the same. However, this time, we will use actual Sierra data, instead of our dummy data. Here, we should
						have in mind three things. <span style="color:darkgreen"> (Slide)</span> Because visualization part of Plotly script remains the same, we only need 
						to take care of the first two things: 1) getting data and 2) transforming it to the Plotly data format. 
						To get data, we need to connect and run a query on Sierra database. How do we do that in a Python program?
						We will use a PostgreSQL database adapter, called psycopg2. With the psycopg2.  
						(the code "sierra_chart.py" ).     
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>SQL Output</h3>
					<img src="images/sql_output.png">
					<aside class="notes"> You may feel a little puzzled on the transformation part. Why do we need to transform 
						Sierra data before using it for Plotly? That's a good question.<br>
	          			It is not possible to feed a sql output directly into a plotly chart, because data structure is different. 
						I will use an example of a query of circulation transaction table (circ_trans). This is the SQL output. Each row 
						present a circulation transaction. 
						Let's picking one column (patron_home_library_code). We are going to present how many  
						circulation transactions happened by patron_home_library (Leahterby, Law, Brandman). 
						The column includes different patron_home_library_codes, which are associated to each circulation transaction.  
						For our purpose, we need to count transactions in that column by each different home_library_code.
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Plotly X Y Axes</h3>
					<img src="images/transform_data.png">
					<aside class="notes">I have chart_data function that takes care of this business. The function reads through 
						each row of the patron_home_library_code column and count the transaction by the patron_home_library_code. 
						Finally, the function retuns a list that is right to feed into Plotly chart.  
						<br><br>
						Look at the code again.  <span style="color:darkgreen"> (Code, "sierra_chart.py)</span>
						The Plotly setup is exactly the same. We only changed the data part (x axis and y axis)
						with the data that we get from Sirrra and transformed. Let's run the script, sierra_chart.py.
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Embed Sierra Charts</h3>
						<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Can we embed multiple charts in one HTML page?</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Use the same SQL output from circ_trans</li>
							<li>Run data transformations on each column</li>
							<li>Pltoly option: output_type = div</li>
							<li>Pass the chart outputs to the template engine</li>
							<li>Prepare a template html that presents multiple charts</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">Can we present multiple charts in a html document? Yes, we can. First of all,
							we have already Sierra data (circulation transaction). For this time, we have to run data transformation
							on each column (patron_home_library, ptype_code, time, op_code, itype_code, item_location). We now can feed 
							the transformed data of each column to Plotly. Let's set the plotly option: output_type=div,
							so that Plotly will ouput charts to divs. The chart outputs will be passed to the template engine and
							the multuple charts will be displayed as specified in the template html file.
							<br><br>
							Now let's run sierra_chart_embed.py. <span style="color:darkgreen">(the code "sierra_chart_embed.py) </span>
						</aside>
					</section>	
					<section>
						<h3>Plotly Offline (3)</h3>
						<img src="images/offline_template.png">
						<aside class="notes">The plotly app output multiple charts as div, which will be passed 
							to the template engine, Jinja2. The engine uses a template file and embed the charts 
							as specified in the template HTML.  
							</aside>					
					</section>											
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Interactive Program</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Can we input specific options?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Python <span style="color:#ff9999">sys.argv</span> - read user inputs from terminal</li>
						<li>User Inputs:
							<ul>
								<li>days (10 => 5)</li>
								<li>transaction types(o i f r = > o i) </li>
								<li>ouput filename</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>python sierra_chart_embed.py 5 oi sierra_interactive.html</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">Now, our program can create a ciculation transaction report with multiple charts. Currently,
						our SQL query find four types transactions (i, o, f, r) in the last 10 days. What about if you want to find 
						only checkout and checkin in the last 5 days? Of course, you can change the sql query accordingly. However, 
						it is not a good idea to modify a sql query inside the program every time when we need a different serach.
						<br><br>
						We have a better way. Psycopg2 (PostgreSQL database adapter) can pass variables to SQL queries. 
						We will get a user input as variables using Python sys.argv. And we will pass them to a sql query 
						using psycopg adapter. In this way, we can create an interactive program. 
						<br><br>
						I am going to demonstrate how it runs. I have three user inputs	(days, transaction types, output filename).
						<br><br>
						<span style="color:darkgreen">(In teminal, run the script, sierra_chart_embed, interactively).</span>
						<br><br>
						I will not go deeper on this subject. But this technique will be used in the next section, Jupyter.

						We use offline.iplot, instead offline.plot. Because we are working 
						on our local Jupyter server, we should turn on init_notebook_mode (Connected=True). Finally, we
						don't need to specify a filename, because Plotly charts will show up on Jupyter, not on a file.

					<h3>Plotly, Sierra SQL, and Jupyter: Summary</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Plotly: View</li>
						<li>Sierra SQL: Data</li>
						<li>Jupyter: Communication</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">You saw how we can utilize three tools together. Plotly can be used to create 
						visualizated charts. We can collect library data using Sierra SQL API (circulation transaction, 
						patron, overdue, bib and items, acq/orders, systerm codes, etc). And we can present the Plotly
						charts and Sierra data on Jupyter dynamically. On Jupyter, a browser-based web application, 
						we may more focus on communicating ideas. 
						<br><br>
						SQL API is not writable. This means that we cannot update records with this API. However, 
						for creating a report, mostly reading data should be enough. Using it in smart ways, 
						we can create library data anlytics tools and handle our real-time data interactively. 
						<br></br>
						Good news is that Sierra APIs is "OPEN" services and approachable anytime. 
						I want to hear your feedback later if this combination does 
						make sense to you.

					<h1>What kinds </h1><h3>of<br> business and collection analytics<br> do we need?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">This is my next question. In many time, we do not get to our point
						because we cannot ask a right question? Is our point getting a fancy system which
						can do milllion things meticulously and omnipresently? I don't think so. Our local library can
						build our own tools that are suitable for their own purpose and in their own context.

					<h3>Library Business & Data Analytics</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Possible to create many analytics tools</li>
						<li>Re-run or auto-run</li>
						<li>Communicate on a Jupyter</li>
						<li>Examples:
							<ul>
								<li>Expired Patrons with Checkouts</li>
								<li>InterLibrary Loan Map:
									<ul>	
										<li>ILL lendings in the last 100 days</li>
										<li>ILL partners</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Using the techniques shown previously, we can create many analytics tools. 
						Once we created the tools, we can re-run or auto-run them conveniently. On Jupyter, we can share 
						data and communicate what we find. 
						<br><br>
						I will share two examples of analytics tools. (Slide)

					<h3>Thoughts</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>More data from Sierra:
							<ul>
								<li>WebPac usages (search, download)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Non-Sierra data: 
							<ul>
								<li>EzProxy</li>
								<li>LibGuides</li>
								<li>Library building usage (gate counter)</li>
								<li>Digital repository system</li>
								<li>And so on...</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Everywhere people talks about data today. We librarians have always handled
						data. We can ask where our data is located. <span style="color:darkgreen">(for example, Slide) </span> 
						We can ask, "can we	harvest certain data?" "Is it valuable or not?" 
						<br><br>
						The ultimate goal of analyzing data is to learn 
						users' interactions with information resource. We can increase the efficiency of library
						services when we know how our users and we consumes our resources.

					<h2>What is the next?</h2>
					<h3>[ Library Data Group ]</h3>
					<h3>Seong Heon Lee, selee@chapman.edu</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Finishing the presentation slide last Friday, I asked myself, "what is the next?"
						I can finish this presentation with the capital "THE END". But something was going on in my mind.
						So, I announce today that I will create "Library Data Group". This group will explore various 
						possibilities of using library data and of creating analytics tool. So, if you are interested in, 
						please send me an email. I think we can grow together teaching and learning each other.
